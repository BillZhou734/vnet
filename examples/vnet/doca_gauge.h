 * Siliding window gauge.
 * gauge is defined by number of bins and total sampled time.
 * more bins means less burstiness but more calculations.
 *
 * The samples are built from count and n, where n is the number
 * of samples added, and count is the samples total value added,
 * when adding only count it means n = 1, in this case.
 *
 * for throughput count = packet size.
 * the rate/sec is the average count per second, or if gauge
 * is defined as a second window, then the sum of count.
